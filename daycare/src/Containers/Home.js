                                We opened our home to provide child care for those who would like an alternative to
                                childcare centers. We are a state licensed home and have been open for the past 10 years.
                                We do have regular compliance checks and strive to take additional courses to better
                                ourselves and in turn are better prepared to take care of every child brought under our care.
